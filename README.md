# JavaScript Monorepo Demo

[![Build Status](https://semaphore-demos.semaphoreci.com/badges/semaphore-demo-monorepo-javascript/branches/main.svg)](https://semaphore-demos.semaphoreci.com/projects/semaphore-demo-monorepo-javascript)

This demo repository teaches you how to use [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to manage JavaScript [monorepos](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/what-is-monorepo). Youâ€™ll build a monorepo from two separate applications.

Check the `final` branch to see the end result.

## Contents

This repository contains two projects. Their folders are:

- `api`: An API that returns geographical information.
- `web`: A static website generated from the information returned by the API.

You can run each project independently or in combination. Check each folder to learn how to run them piecemeal. The next section shows how to run them together.
## Setup monorepo with Yarn workspaces

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone it to your machine.
3. Download latest yarn version.
    ```bash
    $ yarn set version berry
    ```
4. Initialize top-level `package.json`.
    ```bash
    $ yarn init -w
    ```
5. Move projects to their workspaces.
    ```bash
    $ git mv api web packages
    $ yarn workspaces list
    ```
6. Install all modules.
    ```bash
    $ yarn install
    ```
7. Delete old `yarn.lock`
    ```bash
    $ git rm packages/api/yarn.lock packages/web/yarn.lock
    ```
7. Add the new files to the repository. This will also commit all dependencies.
    ```bash
    $ git add .yarnrc.yml .yarn yarn.lock .gitattributes .gitignore package.json .pnp.js
    $ git commit -m "finalize monorepo setup"
    $ git push
    ```
## Run development version

```bash
$ yarn workspace api start &
$ yarn workspace web dev
```

### Run tests

```bash
# Linting
$ yarn workspace api lint
$ yarn workspace web test

# Unit tests - api
$ yarn workspace api start &
$ yarn workspace api test

# Unit tests - web
$ yarn workspace web test

# Integration tests
$ yarn workspace api start &
$ yarn workspace web build
$ yarn workspace web start &
$ yarn workspace web test-integration
```
### Add modules in one workspace

```bash
$ yarn workspace <workspace-name> add <package-name>
```
### Run scripts

```bash
$ yarn worksapce <workspace-name> run <script-name>
```
## Build static site

```bash
$ yarn workspace api start &
$ yarn workspace web build
$ yarn workspace web export
```
